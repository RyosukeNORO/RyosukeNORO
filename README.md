- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RyosukeNORO
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quantum computing, including both theory and fabrication, specifically photonic systems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying generation of arbitrary quabtum states based on photonic systems, quantum kernel, and fabrication of quantum light source (parametric down conversion using non-linear optical crystals)
